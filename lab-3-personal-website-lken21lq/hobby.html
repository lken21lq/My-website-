	<h1>WHY I CHOOSE NEW MEDIA DESIGN?</h1>
	<p> I used to dream of being <strong>a graphic designer</strong> or <strong>a tattoo artist</strong> when I was a kid. But life happened and I did not chase my dream.</p>
</p>I worked for 10 years. tried different things but I could not find my passion.
    	In 2020, I opened my own restaurant with my husband and it is going very well. But it was not what I really wanted. </p> So, finally I decided to give myself a chance even if I don't have any prior knowledge or experience of coding or XD programmes.
		And here I am struggling but I am happy to challenge myslef.
